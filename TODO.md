# TODO

Here is where I track all the things I've thought about adding to the game. Its broken into sections based on when  I added them, then as they are completed they get struck-out with a date.

## 2017-06-15

* Add mobs
  * They should spawn off screen and start walking towards the player
  * Fall off the edge of the map
  * Bounce and reverse direction if they can't move forward
  * Die when shot
  * Kill player when they touch him
  * Low Priority:
    * HP For Player When Hit by mobs
    * Bounce Back Player when hit by mobs

* Add random elements underground (There are some rock tiles that could be sprinkled around)

* Chunk Type: Tunnel
  * Basic tunnel with roof
  * None colliding background texture
  * Low Priority:
    * Fancy entry and exit
    * Whole game darkens while in Tunnel

* Clouds
  * Parallax movement Clouds
  * Move at different rates
